number1 = int(input("Number 1: "))
number2 = int(input("Number 2: "))

sum = number1 + number2

product = number1 * number2

print("The sum of the numbers:", sum)

print("The product of the numbers:", product)

# pretty same principle as the last problem just have to add a sum variable.

# this code works im not sure why im not passing the error i get back is 
# "FAIL: PythonEditorTest: test_additional_tests
#  name 'self' is not defined"

# not sure why maybe someone whos smart can figure this out if they ever see it.
