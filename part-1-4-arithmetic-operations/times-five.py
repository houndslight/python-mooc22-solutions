#FAIL: PythonEditorTest: test_times_five

#Your program's output is incorrect with input 5
#You printed:
#5 Times 5 is 25
#Expected:
#5 times 5 is 25

# uhhhhhhhh

# let me give it another go

# IT WAS A FUCKING CAPITALIZATION ERROR I CANT BELIEVE THIS

# i also cleaned up the code because the "byfive" variable was kinda redundant and just stupid

# if youre doing this course theyre so strict about that its crazy literally gaslighting
