# after reading into it the "end=''" paramater overrides the default newline character with a space between the printed strings

# i didnt need to put an "end=''" on the last line i was just worried it wouldnt start in the first place since i have no clue about these parameters and functions

# in summary this approach lets you print multiple variables or text on the same line without automatically using the default newline characters

# this is something i will definitely keep in mind during my part 1 review of my work and the lessons
