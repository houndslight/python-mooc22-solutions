# Python Programming University of Helsinki Course

I'm trying to get a better understanding of Python and just programming in general so I'm doing this free course I found and I figured why not upload my solutions and progress to my github.

P.S If these answers or comments of me taking notes are pure stupidity my bad I'm just trying to learn lol.


## Requirements

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/)

[MOOC Course](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/grading-and-exams) (This is the newest course to my knowledge I already started on 22 but do know it is outdated.)
